## Quarter 1 - Assignments
1. **[Even Odd Identification](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/even_odd_identification.py)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and identifies whether it is an even or odd number.
2. **[Printing Multiplication Table](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/print_table.py)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and a number up to which multiplication table is required. Multiplication table is printed as an output.
3. **[Finding Variables using Loops](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/loops_assignment.py)**
This program generates 100 random numbers between 10 and 90 and store them in a separate array and computes the following:
	- Sum and average of 100 random numbers
	- Maximum and minimum numbers
	- Count of numbers that are greater than 40
	- Sum of numbers greater than 40
4. **[Guess Game](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/guess_game.py)**
This program generates a random integer between 1 & 10 and then asks user to guess the number three times.
5. **[Common Elements among Two Lists](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/finding_common_elements_lists.py)**
This program identifies common elements among two given lists and stores them in a separate array.
6. **[Character Count](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/character_repetition.py)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts how many times a particular character is repeated in that text.
6. **[Vowels and Consonants Count](https://github.com/ShahidNawaz01/PIAIC-Assignments/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/vowels_consonants_count.py)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts number of vowels and consonants in that statement.
